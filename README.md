# fullstack-6 Quiz App

### Setup

To get the app up and running, please go to the client directory and run `npm install` and then `npm run build`.
Then go to the server directory and follow these instructions in the server README: [Server README](server/README.md)

Further information about commands on the client can be found in this README: [Client README](client/README.md)

Our app can be served from the backend only but you can also serve it on the frontend as long as both the frontend and backend servers are running.
