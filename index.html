    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there! I'm someone who finds joy in the little things. I love listening to music and have also been playing the piano for over 15 years.</p>
    <p>I'm a huge foodie. I love checking out new restaurants to find my next favorite dish. And when I'm not eating out, I'm probably in the kitchen trying to whip up something myself.</p>
    <p>Beyond food and music, I’m into photography. Snapping pics of cool places and moments is a hobby that keeps me exploring. I also love traveling; it’s awesome to see new places and experience different cultures.</p>
