# Page Layout Design

### Design Concept

Themes and ideas were discussed among the groups, and it was agreed that we wanted it to be fun and engaging, and use Arcade/Gaming as a theme.
In addition, we wanted to use bold, bright colours while still thinking about accessibility for the user.

### Page Layouts and Sequence

Overall, the design is intended to slightly replicate an arcade game screen, therefore darker colours were used to simulate a dark arcade atmosphere.
In addition, the Navbar at the top is intended to have a neon effect, also to reflect the dark atmosphere of an arcade setting.
In general, the headings of each page are at the top and the navigation links are at the bottom right of the "screen" so that the pages have a consistent design throughout.

**1. Landing Page**

The landing page is simple, with a design similar to the start screen of an arcade game. It only has one call to action - to start the quiz.

**2. Instructions Page**

![02_Instructions Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4f6f7a6-4732-4ec3-90dd-a90aac9f0e2d)

This page will incorporate the OpenTrivia API and instructions on how to use and generate a quiz.

***Optional Share Quiz Link Page***

![02a_Share Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0270bcd4-da34-4449-8a78-b3090a775e1d)

If we have time, we will implement a feature where the user can generate a quiz link to share with other users to play the same quiz.
The layout is simple so that the calls to action are fairly obvious.

**3. Questions Page**

![03_Quiz Questions Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd897bec-5051-49aa-a5d4-160f3214b54d)

Depending on the subject matter of the quiz (e.g. science and nature), the intention is for the background image on the screen to change to match the subject matter.
In addition, there will be a counter at the bottom to show the progress of the quiz.
If possible, we hope to put some animation on the main question card, which flips and reveals the answer once the user has chosen and clicked one of the answers.

**4. Calculating Modal**

![04_Calculating Modal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1711ff7-b7a8-43ef-8b6b-c86cfd0bc2e1)

Once the user has clicked "Finish" on the last question, there will be a modal to calculate the scores of those participating in the quiz.
The illustration is a placeholder for the moment.

**5.Results Page**

![05_Results Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e72402b1-61e9-4ff7-a6cf-0501b77a6b1d)

This is the final page where the user can see both the scoreboard and their quiz results.

***Optional About Page***

![01a_About Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c455ac0-41e8-4fe6-ba04-a2a6f6c8a194)

This page will have some information about the team.

***Optional Login Page***

![01b_Login Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aabfc7c-84e9-4cf4-bbe2-57e91884b3e1)

The login page will be optional depending on whether we are able to implement an authentication/authorisation process into the application.
